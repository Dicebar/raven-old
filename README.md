# Raven
Dragonflight hotfixes for the latest version of Raven, a World of Warcraft addon, while we reach out to the official maintainer of Raven.

**Note**: For now, download the latest [here](https://dicebar.net/raven/). Do not download Raven directly from Github, the addon Raven_Options is not part of this repository and you'll end up with an incomplete addon.

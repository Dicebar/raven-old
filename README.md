# Raven
Dragonflight hotfixes for the latest version of Raven, a World of Warcraft addon, while we reach out to the official maintainer of Raven.

**Note**: For now, download the latest [here](https://dicebar.net/raven/). Do not download Raven directly from Github, the addon Raven_Options is not part of this repository and you'll end up with an incomplete addon.

## Known issues
- Buffs can't be cancelled using right-click ([#1](https://github.com/Dicebar/raven/issues/1))
- Masque doesn't play nice at the moment ([#3](https://github.com/Dicebar/raven/issues/3))
